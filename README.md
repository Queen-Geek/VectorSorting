# VectorSorting

For this project I implemented my learning with partitioning, quick sorting, and selection sorting bids. First, I began with the partition function, so I may use it for the selection sorting and quick sorting functions. I found someone on Discord to assist me with the issue I was having, to overcome my roadblocks, when Google and YouTube didn't help. I deepened my knowledge on finding errors in code, so the code I write will implement properly. It helped me know how to write code that others can understand, and to add comments for the more difficult function I write.
